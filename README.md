## Getting started

1. Run `npm install` inside your terminal

2. Watch for files and compile Tailwind CSS + Flowbite:

To Watch = `npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch`

3. To deploy you will only need the `index.html` file and the `output.css` styles.

Alternatively you can also just directly copy this code into your own projects, whether you use Laravel, React, Vue.js or other frameworks.
